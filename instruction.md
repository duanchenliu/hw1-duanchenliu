## HW 1 - Visualization Critique & Redesign

### Prerequisite
* Prereadings: [Design and Redesign by Fernanda & Martin](https://bcviscourse.github.io/assets/readings/Design%20and%20Redesign%20-%20Fernanda%20&%20Martin%20-%20Medium.pdf)


* Additional useful reading: [One of Bill Gatesâ€™ favorite graphs redesigned by Stephen Few](https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1829)


### Instruction

In this assignment, you will practice how to give a design critique on existing visualizations and create redesigns of the visualizations. There is no right or wrong when it comes to design. But you should have a rigorous rationale for your critique as well as your redesings. To do so, you should try to articulate the rationale using principles and vocabularies learned from the lectures.

### Part 1. Critique

#### 1. Find three good and three bad visualizations online.

You are free to choose whatever visualizations you find intriguing, excluding things we may not consider as visualizations in our class. Here are some websites where you can find a variety of visualizations from news articles to infographics and statistical graphics:

- [KANTAR Information is Beautiful Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase)
- [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/)
- [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/)
- [Visualizing Data](https://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/)
- [Visual Complexity](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/)
- [Pudding](https://pudding.cool/archives/)
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
- [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/by-week)
- [Data Sketches](http://www.datasketch.es/)
- [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/)
- [Functional Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/)
- [Graphic Detail](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/)
- [ATLAS](https://www.theatlas.com/)
- ([Junk Charts](https://junkcharts.typepad.com))
- ([VisLies](http://www.vislies.org/))
- ([WTF Visualizations](https://viz.wtf/))
- ([r/dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/))


You are encouraged to use the **last four** websites **only for references** when finding bad visualizations. But when you have to use some from the websites, you need to find different design problems or discuss different perspectives (and of course mention the difference in your report). 

You may want to limit your search to **static visualizations**, while using **snapshots of interactive visualizations** are also fine. Please also mention sources of your visualizations in the report.

#### 2. Dissect the visualizations 

Once you find **three good** and **three bad** visualizations, try to analyze the visualizations in light of knowledge you gained from the lectures and readings. Here are some general questions you might ask during your critical analysis:

1. Who is the audience?
2. What message and questions does this visualization convey and answer?
3. What data is encoded in the visualization?
4. How does the visualization encode the data?
5. What tasks readers perform on the visualization (e.g., identify extremes, compare values, seeing trends)?
6. How are the five principles (i.e., truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, enlightening) applied to this visualization?
7. Considering all aspects, why is this visualization good or bad?


### Part 2. Redesign

#### 1. Sketch at least 3 redesign sketches for each bad visualization

Please constantly refer to the reading ([Design and Redesign by Fernanda & Martin](https://bcviscourse.github.io/assets/readings/Design%20and%20Redesign%20-%20Fernanda%20&%20Martin%20-%20Medium.pdf)) to avoid some of the pitfalls in redesigns (ignoring context, omitting data, etc). You do not need to worry about the quality of your sketches for now. Remember that drawing multiple alternatives is a good way to explore and discover something you probably have not thought about. 


#### 2. Pick one of your sketches that you think the best addresses the problem with the original visualization

Now try to explain and justify your design rationale in more depth. You may find it helpful to ask the same questions above to your redesigns as well. Here are some additional questions you may want to think about.

1. What design choices and visual encodings did you use?
2. How does your redesign compare with the original?
3. Why and where do you think your redesign improves upon the original?
4. What trade-offs and comprises did you make? Remember there is rarely a one-size-fits-all design. 


If you happened to have access to the underlying data, you are welcome to convert your sketches into a full-fledged graphic using your favorite design tool. But this is completely optional.

### Part 3. Presentation & Submission


#### 1. Accept the assignment invitation from Github Classroom


Please [go to this link and accept the invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/OHCcA6TK) to create your submission repository for this homework. As in the first lab, you need to [clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) the repository into your local machine and open it with VSCode to work on the code. Please refer to [this instruction]((https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_cloning-a-repository)) on how to clone within VSCode.



#### 2. Put everything into a web page 

Your goal is to nicely present your critique and redesigns into the ```index.html``` available in the initial repository. 

For each critique (good and bad) in [Part 1](#part-1.-critique), you need to at least include the following
* One or more screenshots
* Link to the source
* Your design critique 

For each redesign (for bad ones) in [Part 2](#part-2.-redesign), you need to at least include the following
* Photos (or screenshots) of  all redesign sketches
* Your best redesign
* Your design rationale


You have complete freedom to how to organize the web page (e.g., two column layouts, showing images in one column and design critique and rationale in the other column). Please try to be creative. Bonus: feel free to even make the web page interactive using Javascript.


#### 3. Submission

As in the lab, push your final web page to the remote repository and test it online. Again, you need to go to the Settings page to enable "Github Pages"; use the master branch as the source for Github Pages. If everything goes smoothly, your homework will be available on this url: ```https://bcviscourse.github.io/hw1-[username]/``` Finally, please submit the working url on Canvas. We will use the url to grade your homework. 

*Great job!*
